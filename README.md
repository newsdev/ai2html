# NGM-ai2html

This is a fork of the NYTimes' ai2html. 

This works nicely with the [ngm-ai2html-server](https://github.com/natgeo/ngm-ai2html-server) to provide local AEM previews.

### Enhancements

- Generates font-face definitions for map fonts, supports Verlag and Neue Haas
- Generates font-smoothing css
- Classes more tightly namespaced with "NGAI-"
- Letter tracking within the browser more closely matches Illustrator
- Leading uses ems instead of px

If you’re learning to write Javascript for Adobe Illustrator, [John Wundes](http://www.wundes.com/JS4AI/), has many wonderful scripts. [explore.js](http://www.wundes.com/JS4AI/explore.js) is particularly helpful for understanding what attributes are attached to Illustrator objects.
